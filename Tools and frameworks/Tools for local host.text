1. PyCharm  : In order to run and debbug our program on local machine we will use PyCharm. It is an excellent python IDE which has features like auto code completion, auto code indentation, etc. It has a smart debugger that analyses the code and highlights errors. DS & ML professionals who are into web development prefer PyCharm also because of its easy navigation facility. You can search for any particular symbol used in long codes via the navigation feature in PyCharm. Interlinking multiple scripts is also easier in PyCharm.

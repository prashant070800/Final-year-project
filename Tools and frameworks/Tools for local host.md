# 1. PyCharm  : 
In order to run and debbug our program on local machine we will use PyCharm. 
It is an excellent python IDE which has features like auto code completion, auto code indentation, etc. 
It has a smart debugger that analyses the code and highlights errors. DS & ML professionals who are into web development prefer PyCharm also because of its easy navigation 
facility. We can search for any particular symbol used in long codes via the navigation feature in PyCharm. Interlinking multiple scripts is also easier in PyCharm.

# 2. Jupyter Notebook :
To test the batch of program and to collaborate with members we will be using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. We can test our code as we write via the interactive output
system of JupyterLab. The interface of JupyterLab is quite good as it provides a simultaneous view of the terminal, text editor, console, and file directory.

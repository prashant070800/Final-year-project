***Real time surveillance using Faster R-CNN***

Problem Statement :

It is necessary to make use of automatic video analysis technologies for developing smart surveillance system which can aid the human operator in both detecting and reacting to potential threats.
This project is based on the state of the art object detection network, faster-Region convolutional neural network.  Faster R-CNN, is composed of two modules. The first module is a deep fully convolutional network that proposes regions, and the second module is the Fast R-CNN detector that uses the proposed regions.  The entire system is a single, unified network for object detection
